# Flip Watch

A modern implementation of a classic flip clock using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is my attempt to recreate the iconic "flip clock" (also known as split-flap display) commonly seen in vintage train stations and airports. The implementation uses CSS 3D transforms and animations to achieve realistic card-flipping effects.

## Features

- **Realistic flip animations** - Smooth 3D card rotations with proper physics
- **Modern design** - Glass-morphism effects with gradient backgrounds
- **Fully responsive** - Adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile devices
- **Auto-sync** - Automatically syncs with system time when tab becomes active
- **Pure web technologies** - No frameworks or dependencies required
